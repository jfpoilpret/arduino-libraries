arduino-projects
================

This repository contains all my own reusable libraries for use in my Arduino projects.

I generally create my Arduino libraries first as part of a complete project, created on [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) with an [Arduino plugin](http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/), then I convert them into libraries by copying the necessary files in their own directory.

You can use any of these libraries in your own Arduino projects by copying their content into the libraries directory of your Arduino IDE installation.

Some libraries are used to support circuits I created for a given purpose, e.g. an LED display driver.
For my electronics circuits design, I use 2 useful applications, they are not free but they are quite cheap and very easy (and quick) to use:

- for diagrams, I use [sPlan 7.0](http://www.abacom-online.de/uk/html/splan.html) 
- for stripboards design and wiring, I use [LochMaster 4.0](http://www.abacom-online.de/uk/html/lochmaster.html) for the stripboard circuit. 

If you don't want to buy sPlan or LochMaster, you can still open these files with free viewers for [sPlan](http://www.abacom-online.de/updates/sPlan70_Viewer.exe) and [LochMaster](http://www.abacom-online.de/updates/LochMaster40_Viewer.zip).
